## Acknowledgments

The game is named after the song 'Fueuer frei!'(Fire at will, translated) by German band [Rammstein](https://www.rammstein.de/en/). The same song is used for the soundtrack and the intro image is a picture from the band's concert. Buton, fire, and explosion sounds are from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) website'.
Jared York's [tutorial](https://learn.yorkcs.com/category/tutorials/gamedev/phaser-3/build-a-space-shooter-with-phaser-3/) was very helpful while building the app.
